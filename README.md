**Description** 
This is  a JavaScript program that creates a book list application. The application displays books with their corresponding information such as title, author, and description, along with a search feature that allows users to find books by title, author, or genre. The program also allows users to change the theme of the application from light to dark mode. Additionally, users can load more books to the application by clicking the "Show More" button.
